## function features:

# we can send inputs to the functions and we can access through special variables

#variables inside inside main prorgam can be access and mosified inside and function and vise versa

#functions will have it own exit status but not with exit commonad, we have to use return command with exit status

eg:

fun_name2()
{
  echo hello
  return 1
  #1 is a exit status and it ranges  from 0-255
}

fun_name2
echo exit status of function - $? ###
